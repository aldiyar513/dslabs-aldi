"""Deterministic discrete-event scheduler.

Simulated time only moves when you ask the scheduler to run. ``run_until(t)``
executes every callback due at or before ``t`` in due-time order, jumping the
clock to each callback's due time as it goes. Nothing sleeps and nothing runs
in the background, so a run given the same inputs always produces the same
result, and a simulated hour takes milliseconds of real time.

The scheduler also owns the run's ``Trace``. Timers that belong to a node (the
callback is one of the node's bound methods, or a closure over the node) are
recorded on that node's timeline as set, fired, or cancelled.

For working through a run one event at a time, ``peek()`` describes the next
event without running it and ``step()`` runs exactly one event and returns a
``Step`` listing everything it caused.
