A node only ever touches two things it does not own:

- a ``Transport``, to send messages to other nodes, and
- a ``Scheduler``, to read the clock and to schedule timers.

Keep algorithm code free of anything else (no threads, sleeps, sockets, or
real time) and it will run unchanged in the deterministic simulator or in any
future real runtime.
