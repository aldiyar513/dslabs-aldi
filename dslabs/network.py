"""Deterministic network simulator with fault injection.

How a message travels:

1. A node calls ``transport.send(to, msg)`` on its ``Endpoint``. The endpoint
   stamps ``msg["from"]`` and hands the message to the network.
2. The network turns it into one pending delivery, ``(latency_ms, msg)``, with
   a random latency drawn from the network's base range.
3. Every installed rule is applied in order. A rule maps the list of pending
   deliveries to a new list: it can add delay, drop deliveries, or add copies.
4. Each surviving delivery is scheduled on the scheduler. When it comes due,
   the message is JSON round-tripped, so the receiver gets its own copy exactly
   as it would over a real wire, and passed to the receiver's handler.

Every send, drop (with the rule responsible), and delivery (with its delay) is
recorded in the scheduler's ``Trace`` and tallied in ``network.stats``.

All randomness comes from a ``random.Random(seed)`` owned by the network, so
the same seed always replays the same run.
